A Colorful vision

Vision is more important than sight to color your imaginations 

Painting, as well as other types of artwork, is more than just a visual experience â€” it can also be a rich sensory experience, an opportunity to express yourself, and a way to interact with people from all walks of life. Why should a visual impaired person be barred from it? There are various studies and research work to help them paint/draw. What if a simple initiation using technology can help them achieve it. Painting/Drawing improves with practice and experience and anyone even those with little sight are encouraged to take up this wonderful pastime. It is very therapeutic and relaxing and a great way of enjoying our natural environment.

A system that can give instructions to draw/paint a picture to a visually impaired person and also narrate the scene to them like a instructor and help them throughout the experience is one of the goals of this project.
